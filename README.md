# Calc-using-HTML-CSS-JS
Project Description:



A calculator, as we all know, is a device that makes it easier for us to perform mathematical operations. The majority of calculators, for instance, can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some calculators can also calculate square roots, while more sophisticated ones can aid in calculus and create function graphs. There are calculators everywhere. You could even create a calculator with more complicated features, but we'll keep it straightforward.
Javascript, HTML, and CSS were all used to construct this calculator.
